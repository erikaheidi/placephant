==========

This is a very simple placeholder project featuring lovely elephpants.
It's written on Silex, the microframework based on Symfony 2.

Its Open Source, so you can use the codebase to your very own placeholder thingee. Just change the settings in the app/config/config.yml file and use your own image resources.

Still needs some improvements, of course! You are welcome to PR.

###Coming Soon:

**Black and White images
**More cool elephpant images
